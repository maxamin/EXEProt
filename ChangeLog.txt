The pleasures of sharing code!
The most contributing member has been Matitiahu Allouche, who suggested:

(1) I do something, about the MD5 Key (which maybe actually disguised Credit Card info etc), to protect the user's privacy.
Very true, but the REASON why I am sending the MD5 AND the Hardware Data (though the MD5 is JUST the digest of the Hardware Data itself), is to complete each other's integrity - the publisher can cross check the Hardware data and MD5 to see
that both are the SAME - hence, there's no scope of data corruption/tampering as that can be easily detected.
As for the MD5 being malacious (and as he rightfully pointed out, someone can actually steal the user's Credit Card no and pass it off as HardwareID  - well, the tool is open source! If the user is suspicious, he can inspcet it himself to see what is going on!
Hope that the problems are cleared at this aspect.

(2) Instead of letting the program crash without giving the user a reason, I show him a error message.
Now, this idea is REALLY good - thanks ! It actually NEVER occured to me ;)
Well, we cannot give anything which can compromise the protection system as a check condition, which can help the loader ascretain if the machine is the correct one or not, so what we do is
to keep the MD5 of the decrypted code section in a separate file named "code_sig.sig", and before writing the real code section into the protected PE File, we compare the MD5 of the decrypted "code_sec.dat" with that in "code_sig.sig". If they are the same, we proceed to
write the decrypted code section into the process memory, else we display the message "This machine is not authorised to run this program. Please contact the software publisher at [contact details here] to authorise."

This is exactly what is implemented in this Update of the protection systm - if anybody has a better idea please inform :)

Thanks again to Matitiahu Allouche for his GREAT suggestions !
